{"name":"Euchre-us","tagline":"Euchre files","body":"#Euchre US!\r\n\r\nThis repository is for general files relating to the Euchre US! project.  Finished projects are either owned by their original author or have been transferred to separate [repositories owned by EuchreUS here on GitHub](https://github.com/EuchreUS).\r\n\r\n##About Euchre US!\r\n\r\n[Euchre US!](http://euchre.us) intended to be similar to [99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-Bottles-of-Beer.net) or [RosettaCode](http://www.rosettacode.org) in that it is intended to demonstrate different languages by exploring how it is like the implement the same project into each.\r\n\r\nRather than implement a relatively straightforward project, like having the terminal sing *99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall* to you, this is an implementation of Double-Deck (a.k.a. Bid) Euchre.\r\n\r\n###Why Double-Deck?\r\n\r\nBecause it's much more fun than standard Euchre.  Not to mention it adds some programming complexity because there are two of each card to keep straight.\r\n\r\n##Common Files\r\n\r\n* List of Languages: below\r\n* Requirements for submission: [requirements.md](./requirements.md)\r\n* Rules for Bid Euchre: [rules.md](./rules.md)\r\n\r\n#List of Languages\r\n#####(a.k.a. the L.O.L.)\r\n######Updated 4 December 2015\r\n\r\nIf there are any corrections that need to be made, please open an issue.\r\n\r\n##Completed\r\n\r\n* [C++ (John Ratliff)](http://bideuchre.sourceforge.net)\r\n  * Written in 2005 (predating this project)\r\n  * GPL 2-licensed\r\n  * Won't compile without modification under Mac OS 10.11 (likely due to Visual Studio-specific syntax)\r\n* Java ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))\r\n\t* Written in 2009\r\n\t* Files are M.I.A., so Java will also be added to the unclaimed languages section\r\n\r\n##Under Development\r\n###Mostly Complete\r\nThese are projects that are missing a *single* feature or need some final polish.\r\n\r\n* [C (Chris J.M.)](https://github.com/duck57/Euchre-C)\r\n\t* Still needs level 2 AI and handling of bidding alone\r\n\r\n\r\n###Stub\r\nProjets that have been started but are decidedly __not__ feature-complete.\r\n\r\n* [Swift (Chris J.M.)](http://www.github.com/duck57/Swift-Euchre/)\r\n* Perl ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))\r\n* Haskell ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))\r\n\r\n##Not Started\r\n###Claimed\r\nThe purpose of the \"Claim\" is to let people know that you intend to implement Euchre in a particular language, so they can choose a different one if they're originalily-focused.  You can also make an independent implementation as well.\r\n\r\n* M ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))\r\n\t* a.k.a. ANSI MUMPS, not to be confused with anything Caché-specific\r\n\t* Seems the most diffucult part is getting GT.M set up and playing nicely on Mac OS; please let me know if you've gotten this one working.\r\n\t* If I get GT.M working on my machine, I'll probably put Swift on hold to work on this.  If not, then I'll get Swift mostly complete and move on to Perl, then Haskell.—Chris\r\n* Python ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))\r\n\t1. At the bottom of my priority list, so feel free to claim this if I haven't yet started.\r\n\t2. Let me know if you'd like to collaberate on this one if you don't want to do it alone.\r\n\t* —Chris\r\n\r\n###Unclaimed\r\nOpen an issue if you've started a project in one of these languages or if you have another language to suggest for us.\r\n\r\n* Ruby\r\n* C#\r\n* Objective-C\r\n* LISP\r\n* Scheme\r\n* Java\r\n\t* If I ever find my old Java files, I'll upload them for people to look/laugh at (as they say, write once to throw away)—Chris\r\n* JavaScript\r\n\t* CoffeeScript\r\n\t* TypeScript\r\n\t* Dart\r\n* FORTRAN\r\n* OCaml\r\n* Smalltalk\r\n* Erlang\r\n* Lua\r\n* Go\r\n* Scala\r\n* R\r\n* Matlab\r\n* (Xe)LaTeX\r\n* LilyPond?\r\n* Dart\r\n* Rust\r\n* SQL?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
