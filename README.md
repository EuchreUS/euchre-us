#Euchre US!

This repository is for general files relating to the Euchre US! project.

##About Euchre US!

[Euchre US!](http://euchre.us) intended to be similar to [99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-Bottles-of-Beer.net) or [RosettaCode](http://www.rosettacode.org) in that it is intended to demonstrate different languages by exploring how it is like the implement the same project into each.

Rather than implement a relatively straightforward project, like having the terminal sing *99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall* to you, this is an implementation of Double-Deck (a.k.a. Bid) Euchre.

###Why Double-Deck?

Because it's much more fun than standard Euchre.  Not to mention it adds some programming complexity because there are two of each card to keep straight.

##Completed

* [C++ (John Ratliff)](http://bideuchre.sourceforge.net)
  * Written in 2005 (predating this project)
  * GPL 2-licensed
  * Won't compile without modification under Mac OS 10.11 (likely due to Visual Studio-specific syntax)
* Java ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))
	* Written in 2009
	* Files are M.I.A., so Java will also be added to the unclaimed languages section

##Under Development
###Mostly Complete
These are projects that are missing a *single* feature or need some final polish.

* [C (Chris J.M.)](https://github.com/duck57/Euchre-C)
	* Still needs level 2 AI and handling of bidding alone


###Stub
Projets that have been started but are decidedly __not__ feature-complete.

* Swift ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))

##Not Started
###Claimed
The purpose of the "Claim" is to let people know that you intend to implement Euchre in a particular language, so they can choose a different one if they're originalily-focused.  You can also make an independent implementation as well.

* M ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))
	* a.k.a. ANSI MUMPS, not to be confused with anything Caché-specific
* Perl ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))
* Python ([Chris J.M.](http://www.github.com/duck57))
	* M, Perl, and Swift are all higher-priority, so if you beat me to starting a Python implementation, I understand 100%—Chris

###Unclaimed
Open an issue if you've started a project in one of these languages or if you have another language to suggest for us.

* Ruby
* C#
* Objective-C
* LISP
* Scheme
* Java
* JavaScript
