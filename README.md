# euchre-us
Euchre files


I'm probably going to merge future euchre projects here. For now, Euchre-C is my active project.  If I can find my Java euchre project from 2009, I'll post it.  If not, ANSI M is my next language of choice.

Languages:
C (current project)
Java (from 2009, if I can find it)
ANSI M(UMPS), not to be confused with Cach√©
Perl (future)
Python (future)
Ruby (future)

If you have languages to suggest or you've already implemented Euchre (either double or single deck), let me know and I'll add them to the language list and/or source files.
